# Case Study Proposal: Drop, Helping Candians Earn Rewards
Drop is an application that generates points when a customer uses their debit or credit cards linked to the app to shop. The points are then traded in for gift cards or other gifts at no extra cost.
## Overview and Origin
According to Wikipedia Drop was incorporated in August 2015. The founders of the company are Derrick Fung, Darren Fung, Cameron Dearsley and Akhil Gupta.
* The Idea of the company is to create ways to save money and improve financial health especially for millennials. Basically, since the card for payment is linked to the app, it takes away the stress of scanning receipts and customers automatically get rewarded when they shop.
* In terms of funding, According to Wikipedia, Drop raised $ 1 million around the time of its launch in July 2016. Another seed funding of $ 5.5 million in new capital led by Sierra Ventures with participation from White Star Capital, ff Venture Capital, Portage3 Ventures and HOF Capital in October 2017. Also, in February 2018, the company announced that they had raised a $ 21 million series A round led by New Enterprise Associates. Then in August 2019, Drop announced that their series B round which was  total of $ 44 million, led by HOF Capital & RBC participated as a startegic investor. According to Plaza Ventures, the company has raised $ 71 million to date.
# Business Activities
* The specific problem the company is trying to solve is to improve financial health and create ways to save money.
* The company's intended customer is millenials. According to Plaza Ventures, Drop has over 3 million members.
* One thing Drop offers that its competitors do not offer is it eliminates the need to be involved in different loyalty programs and the need to remember all the loyalty programs. It also removes the stress of having to scan receipts. According to tech crunch, unlike traditional loyalty and reward programs which are built around retail point of sale system, Drop uses banking API's to read credit/debit card transaction data directly thereby giving Drop a 360 view on their transactions. Also, Drop allows customers use their debit card as opposed to several similar companies that may insist on using the credit card. This makes Drop more appealing to a younger demographic since many young people may not have credit cards and may be more focuus on building their credit score at this point.
* The technology used by Drop according to the website, is that same technology used by banks and othher financial applications like RobinHood which may include HTML, Google Analytics, Viewpoint Meta and Iphone/Mobile Compatible. In addition to that, Drops says that the bank login is never stored on the Drop server. It uses the same encryption as your bank and all transactional & personal data are stored with both hardware and software encryption. According to the drop website, Drop also uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure that data is securely transmitted to Drop.
## Landscape
The domain of Drop in the Fintech industry is Payments and Remittance becasue people are able to make payments with the Drop app since their cards are linked to the application.
* The major trends and innovation in the payment and remittance domain are the ease of cross-border payments, cost reduction, transparency and speed,the use of mobile devices, easy to use, and new technologies.
* Major companies in the payment and remittance domain are Apple Pay, Alipay and PayPal.
* The impact of Drop according to Matt Himel, the Head of Business Development & Partnership for Drop, is bridging the gap in the marketplace for marketers who are trying to reach a millennial demographic and also measuring the impact their marketing initiatives have on millennial consumers by targeting consumers who already love products and services similar to theirs by tracking past and future consumer spend to determine the actual returns made.
* The metrics used to measure success by similar Fintech companies according to Yahoo Finanace are: acquisition metrics, activation metrics, retention metrics,referrals, revenues,marketing metrics and technical metrics.
* In terms of acquisition metrics, which relates to app downloads, I believe that Drop is doing relatively well, seeing the growth they have over 1 million plus downloads. The compnay has also launch in the US as well and is hoping to launch in several new countries because it is thriving in relation to other companies in the payment and remittance domain.

# Recommendations
Seeing that paypal is now introducing cryptocurrency on PayPal, I recommend that Drop create an avenue where transactions can be done with cryptocurrency and customers can get points from transactions done with cryptocurrencies as well.
* I believe this would be very beneficial because some many millenials are starting to trade in cryptocurrencies and since this is the major demographic Drop intends to reach, they may need to introduce transactions in crytocurrencies as well.
* The technology Drop would need to support cryptocurrency transactions is blockchain.
* Blockchain technology is appropriate for this sloution because that is the technology currently used by Paypal to support cryptocurrency transactions.
